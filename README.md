# Visual Servo control for target tracking using UAVs
This is a ROS python package of various Visual servo controllers for UAV aiming on target tracking. The general application of these controllers is a dynamic coastline in the presenc of waves.
The different version of visual servoing will be analyzed below.
The controllers were all developed in a UAV synthetic simulation environment: https://github.com/sotomotocross/UAV_simulator_ArduCopter.git

## Classic IBVS method (Study presented on [[1]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9837275))
We initially implemented
